Input and output are performed through the command line or through files. Instruction Set: The PDP-11 instruction set contains 12 basic operations to be performed on memory addresses. Operands are represented by 16-bit words, with the leftmost bits containing the opcode and the rightmost bits containing source, destination, and register addresses. In addition, many other operands are supported, allowing for a wide variety of operations to be performed.\nArchitecture: The PDP-11 architecture is a 16-bit instruction set architecture developed by Digital Equipment Corporation for use with PDP-11 computers. It was widely used in the 1970s, but grew less popular in the 1980s and afterwards.\nMemory Memory is represented by 16-bit words in little-endian format. The smallest addressable unit of memory is 8 bits. Registers R0-R7 can each store one word, which points to a location in the computer\u0026rsquo;s 64KB of memory. Low memory addresses are reserved for two-word vectors that serve as places to store the program counter and processor status.\nCPU Registers The PDP-11 contains eight general-purpose 16-bit registers (R0-R7). Register R7 stores the program counter. Other registers have common but not universal use cases.\nAddressing Modes The PDP-11 computer uses eight \u0026ldquo;addressing modes\u0026rdquo;. Each addressing mode alters the operation of the registers as shown in the following chart.\nCode Name Example Description 0n Register Rn The operand is in Rn. 1n Register deferred (Rn) Rn contains the address of the operand. 2n Autoincrement (Rn)+ Rn contains the address of the operand, then increment Rn. 3n Autoincrement deferred @(Rn)+ Rn contains the address of the address of the operand, then increment Rn by 2. 4n Autodecrement -(Rn) Decrement Rn, then use the result as the address of the operand. 5n Autodecrement deferred @-(Rn) Decrement Rn by 2, then use the result as the address of the address of the operand. 6n Index X(Rn) Rn+X is the address of the operand. 7n Index deferred @X(Rn) Rn+X is the address of the address of the operand. The Program Counter has four addressing modes, and the Stack has 6 addressing modes, both of which alter the operation of the system in their own way.\nLinks GitHub Repository\nWhat the heck is a PDP-11?\nPDP-11 Instruction Set\n","permalink":"https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/code/pdp11-sim/","summary":"Description: This is a C program that accurately simulates the PDP-11 computer\u0026rsquo;s assembly language, complete with virtual memory, CPU registers, and a caching system.
