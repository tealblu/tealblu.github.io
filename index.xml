I identified key areas of application and improvement, and performed ongoing fine-tuning and maintenance to the model based on various metrics.</description></item><item><title>My Projects/Code/LUCA</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/code/luca/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/code/luca/</guid><description>Helped develop and maintain Bosch’s in-house computer vision system. Gradually took ownership of the project and became the sole developer and maintainer of the project.
The system is built from a raspberry pi, 8 NVidia Jetson Nano boards, and 16 high-resolution cameras. The cameras are attached to a 3-axis mount controlled by 3 servo motors. LED lighting strips were added later to the inside of the machine in order to add the ability to customize lighting.</description></item><item><title>My Projects/Code/pdp11-sim</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/code/pdp11-sim/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/code/pdp11-sim/</guid><description>Description: This is a C program that accurately simulates the PDP-11 computer&amp;rsquo;s assembly language, complete with virtual memory, CPU registers, and a caching system. Input and output are performed through the command line or through files. Instruction Set: The PDP-11 instruction set contains 12 basic operations to be performed on memory addresses. Operands are represented by 16-bit words, with the leftmost bits containing the opcode and the rightmost bits containing source, destination, and register addresses.</description></item><item><title>2024-01-20</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/2024-01-20/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/2024-01-20/</guid><description>This is my first page! I intend to use journals (pages titled with a date) as working spaces. All actual content should be on its own page.
Things to note when working on this site:
Logseq-schrodinger uses YAML for the Hugo front-matter. It will convert Logseq page-properties to Hugo front matter.
Logseq keywords are lowercase converted to Hugo keywords, and category in Logseq is translated to categories for use with Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Deployment</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/deployment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/deployment/</guid><description>How to deploy to this site: From Logseq, use schrodinger to export all public pages.
Unzip the new archive and move the new &amp;lsquo;pages&amp;rsquo; folder into tealblu.github.io/content.
Inside tealblu.github.io, open a terminal and run hugo
Create a new commit and push to the remote graph.
Wait a few minutes for Github Actions to run.
Done!</description></item><item><title>Graph Structure</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/graph-structure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/graph-structure/</guid><description>What am I doing? I am figuring out how to structure this graph.
I am defining a structure now so that it stays organized as it grows.
Just a few simple rules can turn chaos into order. Rules should be short and simple.
Rules should be easy to understand.
Why am I doing it? As stated above, so that it stays organized as it grows.
This graph is my public &amp;ldquo;knowledge garden&amp;rdquo;, so I would like it to be as accessible to others as possible.</description></item><item><title>My Projects</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/</guid><description>What kind of projects do I do? I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of different stuff! This collection will hopefully become an archive of my various projects, both for my personal reference and to document for future employment purposes. The types of projects here will include:
Code, programming, and related projects -&amp;gt; My Projects/Code
DIY stuff
Music
And potentially more&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Templates</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/templates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/templates/</guid><description>metadata template:: metadata template-including-parent:: false
