TODO Write about inspection modularization
Let&amp;rsquo;s pause and zoom out for a sec - I don&amp;rsquo;t like the structure of this graph. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with the way I&amp;rsquo;ve structured my Hugo templates.

Code Projects #Diaries 2024-01-21 20:55: The internet is such a cool thing. I spent today working on my website and home automation stuff, and now I&amp;rsquo;m hanging out with my best friends on Discord. We live thousands of miles away, yet we can chat as if we were sitting next to each other. Each day I wake up grateful that I was born in the 21st century.</description></item><item><title>Code Projects</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/code-projects/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/code-projects/</guid><description>Description: This is the collection of my code projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve done over the years.

It is built with C#, CSHMTL, Entity Framework Core, Ebay API, iTunes API, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS EC2, and AWS RDS.</description></item><item><title>Image Classification AI</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/image-classification-ai/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/image-classification-ai/</guid><description>I created an AI for automated classification of production line quality control images on Stratus Vision AOI systems. I identified key areas of application and improvement, and performed ongoing fine-tuning and maintenance to the model based on various metrics.</description></item><item><title>LUCA</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/luca/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/luca/</guid><description>Helped develop and maintain Bosch’s in-house computer vision system. Gradually took ownership of the project and became the sole developer and maintainer of the project.
The system is built from a raspberry pi, 8 NVidia Jetson Nano boards, and 16 high-resolution cameras. The cameras are attached to a 3-axis mount controlled by 3 servo motors. LED lighting strips were added later to the inside of the machine in order to add the ability to customize lighting.</description></item><item><title>PDP-11 Instruction Set Simulator</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/pdp-11-instruction-set-simulator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/pdp-11-instruction-set-simulator/</guid><description>Description: This is a C program that accurately simulates the PDP-11 computer&amp;rsquo;s assembly language, complete with virtual memory, CPU registers, and a caching system. Input and output are performed through the command line or through files. Instruction Set: The PDP-11 instruction set contains 12 basic operations to be performed on memory addresses. Operands are represented by 16-bit words, with the leftmost bits containing the opcode and the rightmost bits containing source, destination, and register addresses.</description></item><item><title>2024-01-20</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/2024-01-20/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/2024-01-20/</guid><description>This is my first page! I intend to use journals (pages titled with a date) as working spaces. All actual content should be on its own page.
Things to note when working on this site:
Logseq-schrodinger uses YAML for the Hugo front-matter. It will convert Logseq page-properties to Hugo front matter.
Logseq keywords are lowercase converted to Hugo keywords, and category in Logseq is translated to categories for use with Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Deployment</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/deployment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/deployment/</guid><description>How to deploy to this site: From Logseq, use schrodinger to export all public pages.
Unzip the new archive and move the new &amp;lsquo;pages&amp;rsquo; folder into tealblu.github.io/content.
May also need to copy the &amp;lsquo;assets&amp;rsquo; folder from the /logseq/ directory to the /content/ directory. Inside tealblu.github.io, open a terminal and run hugo
Create a new commit and push to the remote graph.
Wait a few minutes for Github Actions to run.</description></item><item><title>Graph Structure</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/graph-structure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/graph-structure/</guid><description>Current graph state: Structure Specification: Architecture The graph should consist of multiple hub-and-spoke structures.
The &amp;ldquo;hubs&amp;rdquo; in this system will be called root pages.
The &amp;ldquo;spokes&amp;rdquo; in this system will be called child pages.
Guidelines Any block larger than one paragraph (subjective) should be its own page.
Any page longer than two full screens should be split up.
Full sentences should be used when possible.
No orphan pages should ever be pushed to production.</description></item><item><title>Projects Homepage</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/projects-homepage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/projects-homepage/</guid><description>What kind of projects do I do? I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of different stuff! This collection will hopefully become an archive of my various projects, both for my personal reference and to document for future employment purposes. The types of projects here will include:
Code, programming, and related projects -&amp;gt; Code Projects
DIY stuff
Music
And potentially more&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Templates</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/templates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/templates/</guid><description>Templates can be used to provide structure to an otherwise unstructured graph. They are relatively self-explanatory - by using a slash command (/template), I can choose which template I want and then paste it anywhere in the file that I have open.
