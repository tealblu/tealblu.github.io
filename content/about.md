Hey there! I'm Indigo - a computer scientist and engineer hailing from Greenville, South Carolina. I'm a quick learner who enjoys taking on new challenges and responsibilities - in a past job, I took responsibility for all computer vision systems on the production line within a month of starting my job, made continuous improvements to their vision and software systems, and achieved a savings of over $500k annually. At my current role at Diesel Laptops, I work on reverse engineering vehicle networks and full-stack software development - C# most of the time, although in my personal work I usually use Python. Outside of work, I've taken on leadership roles in academic, professional, social, and political organizations throughout my life. In my free time, [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/656lQkm7XFtA2iW0l984Ya?si=e5cac729d762427f), spending time with my friends, and working on my car ([2005 Saab 9-2X Aero](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15133083/2005-saab-9-2x-aero-road-test/) - if you know you know!). Let's connect!
