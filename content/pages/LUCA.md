Helped develop and maintain Boschâ€™s in-house computer vision system. Gradually took ownership of the project and became the sole developer and maintainer of the project.

The system is built from a raspberry pi, 8 NVidia Jetson Nano boards, and 16 high-resolution cameras. The cameras are attached to a 3-axis mount controlled by 3 servo motors. LED lighting strips were added later to the inside of the machine in order to add the ability to customize lighting.
