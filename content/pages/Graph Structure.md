## Current graph state:

## Structure Specification:

  + ### Architecture

    + The graph should consist of multiple hub-and-spoke structures.

    + The "hubs" in this system will be called **root pages**.

    + The "spokes" in this system will be called **child pages**.

  + ### Guidelines

    + Any block larger than one paragraph (subjective) should be its own page.

    + Any page longer than two full screens should be split up.

    + Full sentences should be used when possible.

    + No orphan pages should *ever* be pushed to production.

    + All root pages should have a category.

    + No child pages should have a category.

## Graph Development Process:

  + ### What am I doing?

    + I am figuring out how to structure this graph.

      + {{< logseq/orgTIP >}}graph: a structured collection of data consisting of interlinked nodes
{{< / logseq/orgTIP >}}

    + I am defining a structure now so that it stays organized as it grows.

    + {{< logseq/orgQUOTE >}}Just a few simple rules can turn chaos into order.
{{< / logseq/orgQUOTE >}}

      + Rules should be short and simple.

      + Rules should be easy to understand.

  + ### Why am I doing it?

    + As stated above, so that the graph stays organized as it grows.

    + This graph is my public "knowledge garden", so I would like it to be as accessible to others as possible.

  + ### What are my rules?

    + Any block larger than one paragraph (subjective) should be its own page.

    + Any page longer than two full screens should be split up.

    + Full sentences should be used when possible.

    + No orphan pages should *ever* be pushed to production.

    + All root pages should have a category.

    + No child pages should have a category.
