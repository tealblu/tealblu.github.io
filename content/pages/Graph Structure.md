### What am I doing?

  + I am figuring out how to structure this graph.

  + I am defining a structure now so that it stays organized as it grows.

  + {{< logseq/orgQUOTE >}}Just a few simple rules can turn chaos into order.
{{< / logseq/orgQUOTE >}}

    + Rules should be short and simple.

    + Rules should be easy to understand.

### Why am I doing it?

  + As stated above, so that it stays organized as it grows.

  + This graph is my public "knowledge garden", so I would like it to be as accessible to others as possible.

### What are my rules?

  + Any block larger than one paragraph (subjective) should be its own page.

  + Any page longer than two full screens should be split up.

  + Full sentences should be used when possible.

  + No orphan pages should *ever* be pushed to production.

  + All root pages should have a category.
