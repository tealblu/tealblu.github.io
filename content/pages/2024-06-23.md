09:12 I need to refactor the code for this website and improve the content. Thereâ€™s not really anything worth reading on it at the moment and I want to change that. I have lots of ideas, but every time I sit down to write at my computer I donâ€™t feel motivated to make content. How can I fix that?

DONE FixÂ [Templates](https://tealblu.github.io/pages/templates/)

  + DONE Check ifÂ `<% today %>`Â macro works for hugo ssg
DONE RedoÂ [ðŸ“„ README.md](https://tealblu.github.io/pages/2024-06-23/)

DONE Homepage changes

  + Change name from archive to something else

  + Rewrite description block

  + Add images

  + Simplify navigation

DONE Get a domain name

  + `indigo.wiki`Â is expensive

  + i got `indi.bio`!

TODO Navigation changes

  + Change title of â€˜archiveâ€™ in search bar to resolve confusion

  + Create tagging system? Seems a bit redundant with categories as well

    + Could change categories to be a bit more obfuscated e.g.:

      + content

      + journal

      + meta

      + other stuff??

    + Then create tags like

      + code

      + blog

      + etc

09:32 Re-export via schrodinger to DONE Check ifÂ `<% today %>`Â macro works for hugo ssg
 as well as check if the block link inside this block works
