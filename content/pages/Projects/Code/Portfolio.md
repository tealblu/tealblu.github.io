On this day Oct 13th, 2023 at 20:17, I shall revive this dead project and turn it into something amazing

Ethos:

  + One hub for everything

  + No specific purpose

  + Easy to navigate

  + Pretty

Exploration

  + Self hosting seems too hard but I don't want to pay for this

  + Potentially use github pages I guess?

    + I want to be able to use more than just javascript

  + Cloud hosting?

    + Seems like the easiest option

    + **20:21** quick capture:  [Cloud Application Hosting for Developers | Render](https://render.com/)

      + Every web service and static site on Render automatically gets a free onrender.com address which does not change. But **you can also bring your own domains to Render easily**.

      + [### Custom Domains | Render Docs](https://render.com/docs/custom-domains#:~:text=Every%20web%20service%20and%20static,own%20domains%20to%20Render%20easily.)

    + **20:22** quick capture:  [The world’s fastest framework for building websites | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

    + **20:48** quick capture:  [Pelican – A Python Static Site Generator](https://getpelican.com/)
    + https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pelican-to-github-pages

      + Notes/Code/Pelican to Github Pages

      + Projects/Code/Pelican to Github Pages

Code

  + Hosting using [Pelican](**20:48** quick capture:  [Pelican – A Python Static Site Generator](https://getpelican.com/)
)
  + WSL directory `~/projects/homepage`

  + To build: `pelican --autoreload --listen`

  + **12:13** quick capture:  [logseq/publish-spa: A github action and CLI to publish logseq graphs as a SPA app](https://github.com/logseq/publish-spa)

  + `make devserver` sets up for testing preview

  + [Publishing to GitHub](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/blob/master/docs/tips.rst#publishing-to-github)

    + To deploy:

```
