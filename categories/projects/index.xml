Input and output are performed through the command line or through files. Instruction Set: The PDP-11 instruction set contains 12 basic operations to be performed on memory addresses. Operands are represented by 16-bit words, with the leftmost bits containing the opcode and the rightmost bits containing source, destination, and register addresses.</description></item><item><title>My Projects</title><link>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tealblu.github.io/pages/my-projects/</guid><description>What kind of projects do I do? I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of different stuff! This collection will hopefully become an archive of my various projects, both for my personal reference and to document for future employment purposes. The types of projects here will include:
Code, programming, and related projects
DIY stuff
Music
And potentially more&amp;hellip;
TODO Flesh out this page and describe the code projects listed on my resume.</description></item></channel></rss>
