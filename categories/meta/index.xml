I am figuring out how to structure this graph.
I am defining a structure now so that it stays organized as it grows.
Just a few simple rules can turn chaos into order. Rules should be short and simple.
Rules should be easy to understand.
Why am I doing it? As stated above, so that it stays organized as it grows.
This graph is my public &amp;ldquo;knowledge garden&amp;rdquo;, so I would like it to be as accessible to others as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
