      <description>If a note is not published, does it really exist? - Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger*spores The phrase &amp;ldquo;digital garden&amp;rdquo; is more of an analogy than a descriptive literal. Just as a mushroom garden flourishes from tiny spores into a complex network, a digital garden nurtures small ideas into a rich, interconnected ecosystem of knowledge. Digital gardens are living entities, constantly evolving as they harbor works in progress, nascent ideas, and fleeting thoughts that, over time, grow and intertwine into a robust network of knowledge.</description>

      <description>I want to write about my code projects. Where can I do that?
Code Projects #Diaries 2024-01-21 20:55: The internet is such a cool thing. I spent today working on my website and home automation stuff, and now I&amp;rsquo;m hanging out with my best friends on Discord. We live thousands of miles away, yet we can chat as if we were sitting next to each other. Each day I wake up grateful that I was born in the 21st century.</description>

      <description>09:12 I need to refactor the code for this website and improve the content. Thereâ€™s not really anything worth reading on it at the moment and I want to change that. I have lots of ideas, but every time I sit down to write at my computer I donâ€™t feel motivated to make content. How can I fix that?

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few projects recently, and I want to add them to the site
TODO Write about image recognition project
TODO Write about inspection modularization
Let&amp;rsquo;s pause and zoom out for a sec - I don&amp;rsquo;t like the structure of this graph. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with the way I&amp;rsquo;ve structured my Hugo templates.

      <description>Helped develop and maintain Boschâ€™s in-house computer vision system. Gradually took ownership of the project and became the sole developer and maintainer of the project.
The system is built from a raspberry pi, 8 NVidia Jetson Nano boards, and 16 high-resolution cameras. The cameras are attached to a 3-axis mount controlled by 3 servo motors. LED lighting strips were added later to the inside of the machine in order to add the ability to customize lighting.</description>

      <description>Description: This is a C program that accurately simulates the PDP-11 computer&amp;rsquo;s assembly language, complete with virtual memory, CPU registers, and a caching system. Input and output are performed through the command line or through files. Instruction Set: The PDP-11 instruction set contains 12 basic operations to be performed on memory addresses. Operands are represented by 16-bit words, with the leftmost bits containing the opcode and the rightmost bits containing source, destination, and register addresses.</description>

      <description>This is my first page! I intend to use journals (pages titled with a date) as working spaces. All actual content should be on its own page.
Things to note when working on this site:
Logseq-schrodinger uses YAML for the HugoÂ front-matter. It will convert Logseq page-properties to Hugo front matter.
LogseqÂ keywordsÂ are lowercase converted to Hugo keywords, andÂ categoryÂ in Logseq is translated toÂ categoriesÂ for use with Hugo.</description>

      <description>How to deploy to this site: From Logseq, use schrodinger to export all public pages.
Unzip the new archive and move the new &amp;lsquo;pages&amp;rsquo; folder into tealblu.github.io/content.
May also need to copy the &amp;lsquo;assets&amp;rsquo; folder from the /logseq/ directory to the /content/ directory. Inside tealblu.github.io, open a terminal and run hugo
Create a new commit and push to the remote graph.
Wait a few minutes for Github Actions to run.</description>

      <description>Current graph state: Structure Specification: Architecture The graph should consist of multiple hub-and-spoke structures.
The &amp;ldquo;hubs&amp;rdquo; in this system will be called root pages.
The &amp;ldquo;spokes&amp;rdquo; in this system will be called child pages.
Guidelines Any block larger than one paragraph (subjective) should be its own page.
Any page longer than two full screens should be split up.
Full sentences should be used when possible.
No orphan pages should ever be pushed to production.</description>

      <description>Templates can be used to provide structure to an otherwise unstructured graph. They are relatively self-explanatory - by using a slash command (/template), I can choose which template I want and then paste it anywhere in the file that I have open.
For more information, check the official Logseq documentation. metadata template:: metadata template-including-parent:: false
date:: YYYY-MM-DD category:: keywords:: public:: true diary template:: diary template-including-parent:: false
